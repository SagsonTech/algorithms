Any problem that has a pattern similar to knapsack can be solved using the same concept.
Problems in which we will have to choose objects according to optimism and a given contrain sum.

Some examples of knapsack pattern problems are - 
1. Subset sum problem
2. Equal sum partition
3. Count of subset sum
4. Minimum subset sum difference
5. Target sum
